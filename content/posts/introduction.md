Hi! I'm Seth. I turn 30 years old at the end of this year and I set a fitness goal to get back into shape after a couple lazy years.

I started running for fun and fitness during college. I ran my first race (a local 15k) in 2013. The next few years, I trained and participated in several other races (5k, 10k, 15k, and half marathon). I did not train very well or consistently and was injured when I jumped into a marathon training program. I stopped running for the couple of years. Now I am back and training intelligently and performing better than before.

I am starting this blog to document my progress and to inspire other runners. I hope to share tips, recommendations, and anything else useful for new and experienced runners.

Thanks for reading! See you at the finish line!
